# Survey Factory

A marketplace for users to post and answer paid surveys on the blockchain.

Users post surveys with demographic criteria. Survey participants can create profiles with demographic data and then get paid answering surveys. Because demographic data input by user is not verified the owner must approve addresses.

The marketplace is managed by the owner who approves addresses and can stop deposits in case of emergency.

## User Stories

A survey maker opens the web app and sees their address and balance of 0 in user account area. They send funds to the contract deposit function so they can fund surveys. They creates a survey with demographic criteria and content is uploaded to IPFS and contract storage. They can withdraw funds from account.

A survey participant opens the web app and sees their address and balance of 0 in user account area. They create a profile with their demographic information. The participant sees a list of surveys with pay rates and demographic criteria. They add survey number to empty input field and press Get Survey button to get survey question from ipfs. Participant submits answer and is paid if they match demographic criteria. They can then withdraw any earnings.
